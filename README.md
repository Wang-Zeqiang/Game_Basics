This is a C++-coded turn-based card game constructed based on Tarot cards. Current functionalities include drawing a card, attacking, healing, and leveling up. The game is open for further development by including more Players' occupations based on Tarot. It is also a portfolio project for my CSCI103 course, demonstrating my understanding of classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. I will (very likely) make this game more playable by including more features (occupations, buffs) and adjusting the numerical values in the future.

To compile the code: g++ -g -Wall Cards.cpp Players.cpp Interface.cpp -o game To run the program: ./game
