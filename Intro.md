This is a C++ coded turn-based card game constructed based on Tarot Card. Current functionalities including draw a card, attack, healing, and leveling up. 
The game is open for further development by including more Players occupations based on Tarot.
It is also a portfolio project for my CSCI103 course, demonstrating my understanding of class, inheritance, and polymorphism.
I will (very likely) make this game more playable by including more features (occupations, buffs) and adjusting the numerical values in the future.
